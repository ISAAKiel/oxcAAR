oxcAAR
======

`oxcAAR` (previously named `roxcal`) is a collection of functions that
can be used to execute [OxCal](https://c14.arch.ox.ac.uk) from within R.

Please note that there is a [`roxcal`
package](https://github.com/gavinsimpson/roxcal) package on Github,
created by [Gavin Simpson](https://github.com/gavinsimpson). If you just
need to import OxCal result files, you may consider using his package.

Licence
-------

`oxcAAR` is released under the [GNU General Public Licence, version
2](http://www.r-project.org/Licenses/GPL-2). Comments and feedback are
welcome, as are code contributions.

Installation
------------

`oxcAAR` is available on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/oxcAAR/index.html) and can be installed through `install.packages("oxcAAR")`. You can use [devtools](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=devtools) to install the development version. To do so:

    if(!require('devtools')) install.packages('devtools')
    library(devtools)
    install_github('ISAAKiel/oxcAAR')

Get started
-----------

To get started, just run:

    quickSetupOxcal()

This will download and unzip
[Oxcal](https://c14.arch.ox.ac.uk/oxcal.html) into tempdir(). You can
change the destination path of Oxcal by setting the `path` parameter.

Afterwards you can start calibrating your dates. Check the
[Vignette](vignettes/basic-usage.Rmd) to learn how to do this.
