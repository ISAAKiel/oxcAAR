# roxcal

`roxcal` is a collection of functions that can be used
to execute [Oxcal](https://c14.arch.ox.ac.uk) from within R.

Please note that there is a [second `roxcal` package](https://github.com/gavinsimpson/roxcal) package on Github, created by [Gavin Simpson](https://github.com/gavinsimpson). If you just need to import Oxcal result files, you may consider using his package.

# Installation

`roxcal` is currently not on [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/), but you can use
[devtools](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/devtools/index.html) to
install the development version. To do so:

    if(!require('devtools')) install.packages('devtools')
    library(devtools)
    install_github('MartinHinz/roxcal')
