# oxcAAR

`oxcAAR` (previously named `roxcal`) is a collection of functions that can be used
to execute [OxCal](https://c14.arch.ox.ac.uk) from within R.

Please note that there is a [`roxcal` package](https://github.com/gavinsimpson/roxcal) package on GitHub, created by [Gavin Simpson](https://github.com/gavinsimpson). If you just need to import OxCal result files, you may consider using his package.

## License

`oxcAAR` is released under the [GNU General Public License, version 2](https://www.R-project.org/Licenses/GPL-2). Comments and feedback are welcome, as are code contributions.

## Installation

To install the stable version from  [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org):

    install.packages('oxcAAR')

To install the latest development version: 

    if(!require('devtools')) install.packages('devtools')
    library(devtools)
    install_github('ISAAKiel/oxcAAR')
    
## Get started

To get started, just run:

```
quickSetupOxcal()
```

This will download and unzip [OxCal](https://c14.arch.ox.ac.uk/oxcal.html) into tempdir(). You can change the destination path of OxCal by setting the `path` parameter. Please make sure that you have a working internet connection when attempting to use this function! 

Afterwards you can start calibrating your dates. Check the [Vignette](vignettes/basic-usage.Rmd) to learn how to do this.
