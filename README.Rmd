# oxcAAR

`oxcAAR` (previously named `roxcal`) is a collection of functions that can be used
to execute [OxCal](https://c14.arch.ox.ac.uk) from within R.

Please note that there is a [`roxcal` package](https://github.com/gavinsimpson/roxcal) package on Github, created by [Gavin Simpson](https://github.com/gavinsimpson). If you just need to import OxCal result files, you may consider using his package.

## Licence

`oxcAAR` is released under the [GNU General Public Licence, version 2](http://www.r-project.org/Licenses/GPL-2). Comments and feedback are welcome, as are code contributions.

## Installation

`oxcAAR` is currently not on [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/), but you can use
[devtools](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/devtools/index.html) to
install the development version. To do so:

    if(!require('devtools')) install.packages('devtools')
    library(devtools)
    install_github('ISAAKiel/oxcAAR')
    
## Get started

To get started, just run:

```
quickSetupOxcal()
```

This will download and unzip [Oxcal](https://c14.arch.ox.ac.uk/oxcal.html) into tempdir(). You can change the destination path of Oxcal by setting the `path` parameter. 

Afterwards you can start calibrating your dates. Check the [Vignette](vignettes/basic-usage.Rmd) to learn how to do this.
